# SOLID Principles Java
In Java, SOLID principles are an object-oriented approach that are applied to software structure design

# S : Single responsibility principle (SRP)
it states that every must perform a single functionality.

# O : Open close Principle
it states that according to new requirement a module should be open to enhancement but close to modification

# L : Liskov substitution principle
it was introduced by Barbara Liskov,
it is applies to inheritance in such a way that derived class mush be completely substitutable for their base class.

# I : interface segregation principle
this states that we should split large interface into smaller ones because the implementation class use only the methods that are required
we should force the client to use the method that they do not want to use

# D : Dependency Inversion Principle
it states that we should be using abstraction (abstract class /Interfaces) instead of concrete implementation
High-level module should not be depend on low level module both should be dependent on abstraction
